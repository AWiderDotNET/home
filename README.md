# Welcome to AWider.NET!

AWiderDotNet is a community dedicated to furthering sustainability and community in .NET open source, though we hope it will be applicable far beyond the .NET world as well.

This home repository is the best way to find your way around the org and our efforts.

## A Focus on Impact

At its heart, this project is about mapping out the different ways we might achieve better outcomes around OSS sustainability and community, and creating space/focus for those outcomes to happen.

To achieve these impacts, we're using [a tool commonly known as impact mapping](https://www.impactmapping.org) which allows for divergent ideas and a way of thinking about influencing outcomes that we think will be very helpful. We'll use the impact map items to drive a rough outline of priorities for our organization, at which point we'll explore the problem space and then welcome contributions around those items.
